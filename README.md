September 30, 2020 - present
Currently maintaining this project and issuing software updates when necessary.

September 30, 2020
Released the Chrome Extension to all school managed Chrome profiles, located outside the Chrome Web Store for convenience.

October 2020 - September 2020
Developed a Chrome Extension which would display class schedules, bulletins, competitions, and push notifications to managed school Chromebooks. This program uses the same REST API as the iOS app, and can be managed by admins in the admin control panel I developed.
